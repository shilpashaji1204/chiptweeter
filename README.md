# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page AJAX - based Twitter clone that uses jQuery,HTML,CSS, and JS. CSS is used to apply styling to HTML pages. This includes changing fonts and colors, but it also allows us to change the layout of our page. There are many ways to position and display items with CSS, and each method is appropriate for different use cases.
